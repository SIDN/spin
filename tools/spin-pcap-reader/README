	spin-pcap-reader:
	Parse a pcap file and communicate results to spind


==> Introduction

The program in this repository parses a PCAP file and communicates its findings
to spind through a socket.


==> Dependencies

 * libpcap


==> Compiling the program

Follow the SPIN build instructions. When running configure, make sure to pass
--enable-spin-pcap-reader.


==> Usage

Before making use of the examples below, make sure to cd to the directory where
spin-pcap-reader was built, for instance:

  $ cd build/tools/spin-pcap-reader

Parse file.pcap.

  $ sudo ./spin-pcap-reader -r file.pcap

Listen on eth0.

  $ sudo ./spin-pcap-reader -i eth0

Note: for now, it is necessary to run spin-pcap-reader as root. This is because
the socket created by spind can only be written to by the root user.
