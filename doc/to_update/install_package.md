## Installation on existing OpenWRT router

You can install spin on an existing OpenWRT installation.

At this moment this requires a few additional steps.

### Add the custom package feed

Log into your openWRT router with ssh, and add the following line to `/etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf`:

    src/gz	sidn	https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/downloads/packages/<version>/<architecture>/sidn

Version is either 'snapshots' (for the latest openWRT snapshot) or 'openwrt-18.06' (for the latest openWRT release). 

Architecture depends on your specific router model, you can see which one you need in `/etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf`.

Add the SIDN feed key to opkg:

    cd /tmp
    wget https://valibox.sidnlabs.nl/downloads/packages/sidn_public.key
    opkg-key add sidn_public.key

Update the package feeds:

    opkg update

Install spin and its dependencies:

    opkg install spin

SPIN is now installed, but in order to use the front-end part, there are a few additional steps:

Configure mosquitto to use websockets. Add the following lines to /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf (if your internal IP address is different, modify as necessary):

    port 1883 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.1

    listener 1884 192.168.1.1
    protocol websockets

    allow_anonymous true

Configure the web server to serve the static pages and reverse proxy, we currently have example files for nginx only, but intend to add lighttpd config as well:

If you are running nginx, copy the following sections into the relevant server settings (the local network part):

	location /spin {
	    root /www;
	    index index.html;
	}
	location /spin_graph {
	    alias /usr/lib/spin/web_ui/static/spin_api;
	    index graph.html;
	}

	location /spin_api {
	    proxy_set_header        Host $host;
	    proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	    proxy_http_version      1.1;
	    proxy_pass_request_headers      on;
	    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';

	    # Fix the â€œIt appears that your reverse proxy set up is broken" error.
	    proxy_pass          http://localhost:8002;
	    proxy_read_timeout  90;
	}

Start or restart the spin daemon and webui:

    /etc/init.d/spin restart
    /etc/init.d/spin_webui restart


**TODO IN DOCUMENTATION:**

- better way to configure nginx? the default nginx config does not have something akin to 'include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf'.
- what to do when (only) uhttpd is installed and no webserver. can uhttpd be reverse proxy too?
- lighttpd example
